This map contains all the fonts available for Team Mind Engine Developers.
Each font had a license to be used in the project.

All fonts have a css file on our server that is automatically imported into all css root files for typography.

Add the fonts with ease to a specific text element for clients.


If you want to add a new font, please follow these steps:

1. run script to generate fonts.css file
2. node generate-fonts.js
3. this will generate a fonts.css file in the fonts folder
4. the fonts.css is automatically imported into the import.css file in the root of the project
